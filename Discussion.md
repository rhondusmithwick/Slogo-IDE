 * I refactored pieces of the front end code because that is what I have been working on. I took care of issues that were brought up by the sonar cube, so now there are no issues in our front end code. I mostly refactored the turtle selector class because that was newly written by my partner and had not been refactored yet. I removed some things from the constructor as they didn't really need to be passed to this class. I also removed some methods because they were only one line and only used in one place, and thus did not really need to be their own method.  I also added in documentation for this class as it was the only class in the front end that did not have public api. I also refactored parts of the toolbar class and removed some uneeded methods.
 * I was not on campus for this lab and thus did it alone. I did let my team know well in advance that I would be missing this lab.
