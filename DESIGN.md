# Introduction
The goal of this project is to closely integrate frontend and backend APIs, allowing
different teams to easily communicate to reach a common goal. There must be
flexibility in terms of how the turtle executes its commands, and it must be easy for
the frontend and backend to communicate changes to the turtle. The frontend will be
closed to the backend, only passing a turtle object to the backend. The backend will
open up only a facilitator class to the frontend. All of its other classes will be closed.
