We chose to refactor all of the classes in the turtleboolean package. This is to follow the already set convention set by other packages
where the function that is applied to the inputed variables is passed from each subclass to the super class, which then handles any subsequent
actions. This streamlines the code a bit more and allows for more flexibility and ease if we ever wanted to add more turtleboolean classes. 
This also follows a better hierarchical design.
